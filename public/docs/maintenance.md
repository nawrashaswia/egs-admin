# üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance & Backup Guide

EGS-ADMIN provides a robust maintenance system for folder exports, database backups/restores, and full system ZIP backups. All tools are modular, safe, and designed for reliability.

## üÜï Dev Mode Switcher
A new switcher is available in the Maintenance UI to enable or disable **Dev Mode**.

- **Location:** Maintenance UI (`/system/maintenance`)
- **Config:** Controlled by `dev_mode` in `/config/app.php`
- **How it works:**
  - Toggle the switch to enable or disable developer features
  - When enabled, the system may show extra debug info, stack traces, or allow advanced tools
  - When disabled, the system hides debug info and restricts sensitive actions
- **Confirmation:**
  - When you switch dev mode, a message will explain what enabling or disabling means for your environment and security
